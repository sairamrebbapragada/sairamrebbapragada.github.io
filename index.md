## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Hyderabad. I am fortunate to be a part of the Machine Learning and Vision group supervised by [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/). 

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Object detection, Segmentation, Tracking, Deep Learning

## Brief objectives of my Research work in PhD:

As part of my thesis, I am developing computer vision algorithms for drone swarms. Drones have diverse applications in fields such as military warfare, agriculture, search-and-rescue, fire-fighting, delivery, and photography. Aerial object detection from drones presents unique challenges, including high occlusion, arbitrary orientation, varying scale, and crowded objects. Using multiple drones (swarms) improves detection performance and robustness against visual ambiguity. I am currently working to address these challenges and create an efficient multi-drone system.

<!-- I work on developing computer vision algorithms for swarms of drones. In military warfare, they can be used as target decoys for combat missions. In agriculture, drones provide farmers with real-time data to make informed harvesting decisions. For search-and-rescue, they can reach places where humans cannot. Alternatively, they are also used in fire-fighting, delivery of essentials and aerial photography. This increasing demand for drones in various domains has recently encouraged the computer vision community to work extensively on vision from drones. Compared to general object detection, aerial object detection (especially, object detection on images captured from drones) has additional challenges, some of which are high occlusion, arbitrary orientation, high variation in scale and small sized crowded objects. The above problems can be resolved by using multiple drones, which improves object detection performance and robustness against occlusion and visual ambiguity. I am working to solve the challenges one after another, which is necessary for designing an efficient multi-drone system.  -->

## Hobbies: 
I enjoy playing volleyball, table tennis, and carroms in my free time. Cooking is also one of my favorite pastimes. Additionally, I have a talent for whistling songs and playing the cajon.
