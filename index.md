## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Hyderabad. I am fortunate to be a part of the Machine Learning and Vision group supervised by [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/). 

## Research Interests

- Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Tiny Object detection, Aerial/Oriented Object Detection.

## Brief objectives of my Research work in PhD:

Aerial vision has diverse applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, construction, UAVs, military, and search-and-rescue operations. The increasing demand has sparked research in developing computer vision algorithms for aerial perspectives, particularly aerial object detection. Aerial vision presents a complex array of challenges, including severe size imbalances, detection of minuscule objects, managing motion and instability, constraints posed by limited computational resources, real-time processing requirements, dealing with occlusions and perspective distortions, handling inaccuracies in data annotation, ensuring generalization across diverse environmental conditions, and addressing pivotal privacy and ethical considerations. 

In the pursuit of my Ph.D., I am dedicated to methodically tackling these multifaceted challenges by developing and applying innovative and contemporary methodologies, including the Vision Transformers, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), to the field of aerial vision.

<!-- In recent years, drones have demonstrated significant potential across a variety of industries, spanning from agriculture, military operations, and search-and-rescue missions to firefighting, aerial photography, and essential deliveries. The growing demand for drones has ignited extensive research efforts focused on augmenting their vision capabilities, especially object detection.

The application of computer vision to drones presents a complex array of challenges, including severe size imbalances, detection of minuscule objects, managing motion and instability, constraints posed by limited computational resources, real-time processing requirements, dealing with occlusions and perspective distortions, handling inaccuracies in data annotation, ensuring generalization across diverse environmental conditions, and addressing pivotal privacy and ethical considerations.

In the pursuit of my Ph.D., I am dedicated to methodically tackling these multifaceted challenges. My research endeavors to enhance the vision capabilities of drones, paving the way for more effective and ethical deployment in a broad range of applications. -->

<!-- I work on developing computer vision algorithms for swarms of drones. In military warfare, they can be used as target decoys for combat missions. In agriculture, drones provide farmers with real-time data to make informed harvesting decisions. For search-and-rescue, they can reach places where humans cannot. Alternatively, they are also used in fire-fighting, delivery of essentials and aerial photography. This increasing demand for drones in various domains has recently encouraged the computer vision community to work extensively on vision from drones. Compared to general object detection, aerial object detection (especially, object detection on images captured from drones) has additional challenges, some of which are high occlusion, arbitrary orientation, high variation in scale and small sized crowded objects. The above problems can be resolved by using multiple drones, which improves object detection performance and robustness against occlusion and visual ambiguity. I am working to solve the challenges one after another, which is necessary for designing an efficient multi-drone system.  -->

## Hobbies: 
I enjoy playing badminton, volleyball, table tennis, and carroms in my free time. Cooking is also one of my favorite pastimes. Additionally, I have a talent for whistling songs and playing the cajon.
